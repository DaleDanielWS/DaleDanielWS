Hello, I am an applications engineer at Wilder Systems with a background in designing feedback control systems.
I enjoy problem solving, coding, testing, design, and pretty much anything related to Math/Science/Engineering.
The harder I have to think, the more I will enjoy solving the problem. 
I am excited to work alongside the awesome people at Wilder Systems to develop autonomous robotic solutions to all the problems the world has to throw at us.
